class Function:
    ''' Implements functionality for:
        - Carrying out cyclic transducer/device polling
        - Save values and send to viewer for displaying
        - Cyclic task management
        - Calculation of decay rates and predicted end pressures
        - Setting of alarms for exceedance
        - Storing of device calibration data (Sent by device prior to testing). '''
